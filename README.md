Quiz System
===

This comes in three parts. The "setup" client, the "player" client and the server. To get this working you will need to start the server first (java QuizServer) and then start either the player client or the setup client (or both) by running java QuizPlayer or java QuizSetup respectively. Imports are done between packages as these are on the same machine but if they were not they would use external library reference jar files.
